# indicorp
HTML/CSS implementation of a free Figma design.

See the Figma design here: https://figmaland.com/templates/indicorp-figma-corporate-web-page-template

I used the Bootstrap 5 framework.

I wrote the SCSS code for the design. I override some Bootstrap variables like $primary, imported bootstrap.scss and compiled to produce a single styles.css file. I also used dist version of bootstrap.js to make hamburger menu work on small screens.
